HOW TO INSTALL THE LATENT VISUALISATION APP:
1. Download the three files.
2. Add the download location as the directory path.
3. Open and run Latent_Visualisation_Base.mat
4. The app will now appear in a separate window.

HOW TO USE:
You have two handles on the sliding bars corresponding to the x- and y- viewpoint.
The viewpoint is then visualised in the two plots with the resulting loading vectors on the bottom right.
You can choose to select the eigenvectors as the transformation to yield the PCA rotation.
